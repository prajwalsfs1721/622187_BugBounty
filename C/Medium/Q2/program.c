/* 

PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
    Now that Messi is leaving Barcelona a football fan wants to show a list of all his favourite football players and their jersey numbers.
    He is writing a C program to read players names and jersey numbers from a file, store them to an array of structures and display their details.
    Unfortunately he ran into a few bugs. Solve those bugs and he will give you the KEY as a token of appreciation for helping him.

INPUT:
    1. This is taken from a file. Do not modify the contents of the file.

OUTPUT: 
    1. Names and Jersey numbers of players, and the KEY which is to be entered into the website
    messi 10
    ronaldo 7
    pulisic 22
    giroud 18
    drogba 11
    lampard 8
    terry 8
    KEY to be entered in website is: XXXXXX43
